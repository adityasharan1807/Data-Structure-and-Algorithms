- **Architecture Patterns**: Common architectural patterns such as microservices, monoliths, and serverless architectures.
- **Designing for Scale**: Techniques for designing systems that can handle high traffic and large data volumes.

## 6. Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Review of common algorithms and problem-solving strategies.
- **Data Structures**: In-depth understanding of data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs.
- **Coding Exercises**: Hands-on coding exercises and challenges to reinforce algorithm and data structure knowledge.

## 7. Security
- **Security Best Practices**: Training on coding securely, including practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Data Privacy**: Understanding data privacy laws and regulations relevant to the company.

## 8. Performance and Optimization
- **Profiling and Monitoring**: Tools and techniques for profiling code and monitoring system performance.
- **Performance Tuning**: Strategies for optimizing code and systems to improve performance.
- **Load Testing**: Conducting load testing to ensure systems can handle expected traffic.

## 9. Product and Domain Knowledge
- **Product Training**: Understanding the company’s products, services, and user base.
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Specialized training relevant to the specific domain the engineer will be working in (e.g., e-commerce, streaming, social networking).

## 10. Soft Skills Development
- **Communication Skills**: Effective communication techniques for working within and across teams.
- **Leadership Training**: Leadership principles and opportunities for growth into leadership roles.

### Example Training Program Breakdown
Here’s an example of a potential SDE training program structure at a FAANG company:

| Week | Focus Area                        | Activities                                      |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Orientation and Culture           | Company overview, values, and mission sessions  |
| 2    | Development Environment Setup     | Setting up tools, IDEs, and version control     |
| 3    | Codebase Familiarization          | Navigating the codebase, key repositories       |
| 4    | Coding Standards and Practices    | Coding guidelines, code reviews                 |
| 5    | Agile Methodologies               | Scrum training, sprint planning                 |
| 6    | Technical Skills Enhancement      | Language-specific training, frameworks overview |
| 7    | Systems Design                    | Design principles, architecture patterns        |
| 8    | Data Structures and Algorithms    | Algorithm exercises, coding challenges          |
| 9    | Security                          | Secure coding practices, authentication         |
| 10   | Performance and Optimization      | Profiling tools, load testing                   |
| 11   | Product and Domain Knowledge      | Product-specific training, domain insights      |
| 12   | Soft Skills Development           | Communication workshops, leadership sessions    |

This comprehensive approach ensures that SDEs at FAANG companies are not only technically proficient but also well-integrated into the company’s culture and capable of contributing effectively to their teams.
