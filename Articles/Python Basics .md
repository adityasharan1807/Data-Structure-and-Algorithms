# Python Variables and Data Types
Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you can create a variable and assign it a value like this:

python
Copy code
# Variables and Data Types
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_student = False
Python supports several data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. Here are a few examples:

python
Copy code
# Data Types
num = 42         # Integer
pi = 3.14        # Float
message = "Hello, Python!"  # String
is_open = True   # Boolean
