# Compiler vs Interpreter

| Feature              | Compiler                                               | Interpreter                                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Translation Process  | Translates the entire code into machine code at once.   | Translates code into machine code line by line.          |
| Execution Speed      | Generally faster, as the entire program is compiled.    | Generally slower, as it translates and executes line by line. |
| Error Detection      | Errors are detected during the compilation process.     | Errors are detected during execution.                    |
| Output               | Produces an executable file.                            | No separate executable file; executes directly.          |
| Memory Usage         | Typically requires more memory for the entire program. | Typically requires less memory at any given time.        |
| Example Languages    | C, C++, Rust, Go                                        | Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl                           |
| Debugging            | More difficult, as the entire program must be compiled. | Easier, as errors are found at runtime and can be fixed immediately. |
| Reusability          | Compiled code can be distributed and run without source code. | Source code must be available for execution.             |
| Platform Dependency  | Requires recompilation for different platforms.         | Can run on any platform with the appropriate interpreter. |
