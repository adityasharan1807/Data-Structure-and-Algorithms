## Two pointers

### When to Use the Two Pointers Algorithm:
* **Sorted Arrays**: Many problems involving sorted arrays benefit from the two pointers technique because sorting simplifies the conditions for comparisons.

* **Optimization**: When you need to improve from a brute-force solution (which might be O(n^2) or worse) to something more efficient, often O(n) or O(n log n) with the help of sorting.

* **Linear Time Complexity:** If you need to solve a problem in linear time, but sorting alone doesn't suffice, using two pointers in conjunction with sorting can be very effective.
